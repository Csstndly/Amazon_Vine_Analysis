## Summary
From the data there is a posivitity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Despite Vine reviews being signifacntly lower in total reviews (94 reviews)the majority of 5star reviews come from the Vine program, implying that reviewers are rating video games better to continue being paid to review games in the future. 

An additional analysis that can be done is to look at the other side of the spectrum. Compare against 1 star reviews between Vine and non-Vine reviews to see how much positivty bias effects giving low reviews.
